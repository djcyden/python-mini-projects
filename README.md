# 🧩 Python Mini Projects

A collection of small Python projects designed to reinforce **core programming skills** through practice.  
Each project focuses on solving a specific real-world problem — from simple CLI scripts to working with files, JSON, data, and logic.

---

## 🎯 Repository Goals

- Strengthen Python knowledge through **hands-on tasks**  
- Develop the ability to **write code independently**, not just follow tutorials  
- Build a solid foundation for:
  - 🖥️ **Backend development** (FastAPI, databases)  
  - 🧪 **QA Automation** (pytest, Selenium / Playwright)  
  - 📊 **Data processing** (JSON, CSV, Faker, SQLite)  
- Grow an engineering mindset and build a practical **portfolio**

## 📚 Learning Approach

Each mini project serves as a **practical milestone** —  
a small, self-contained exercise to test real coding skills and improve problem-solving ability.

## 🗓️ My Progress Diary

All learning logs and daily notes are stored in the  
📁 [`/diary/`](diary/index.md) folder — documenting progress, reflections, and next goals.  

Example entries:
- 🧮 [Python Basics Completed — Calculator Project](diary/2025-11-07_python_basics_complete.md)
- 💡 Next: Debug version improvements and To-Do Manager prototype
